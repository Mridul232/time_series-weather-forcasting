# time_series-weather-forcasting
The goal of this project is to forecast future temperature trends by applying time series forecasting methods to past temperature data. The project applies statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA) and exploratory data analysis (moving averages, ACF/PACF diagnostics) to pattern, seasonality, and stationarity in temperature data.
